# Bitcoin Cycles Indicator - Improvement Suggestions

## 1. ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Replace Linear Search
- Current: `findHighestIndex` uses linear loop through bars
- Better: Use built-in Pine functions or rolling maximum
- Impact: Significant speed improvement for long timeframes

### Reduce Array Operations
- Current: `barIndexes` array grows on every bar
- Better: Use more efficient data structures or limit history
- Impact: Reduced memory usage and better performance

### Optimize Label Updates
- Current: Labels deleted/recreated frequently
- Better: Update existing labels when possible
- Impact: Smoother visual experience

## 2. üèóÔ∏è Code Organization & Maintainability

### Modular Functions
- Break large main section into focused functions:
  - `updatePotentialLabels()`
  - `finalizeCycle()`
  - `drawProjectionBox()`
  - `calculateOffsets()`

### Configuration Management
- Create centralized configuration object
- Group related settings together
- Make parameters more discoverable

### Reduce Code Duplication
- Similar offset calculation logic appears multiple times
- Extract common patterns into reusable functions
- Simplify complex conditional blocks
