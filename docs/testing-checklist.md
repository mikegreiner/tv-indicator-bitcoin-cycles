- [ ] Labels show "Day: X" progression
- [ ] Labels positioned logically (highs above price, lows below)
- [ ] No label overlap on same bar
- [ ] Labels update as new bars form

### Info Box Validation
- [ ] Current cycle day count increases over time
- [ ] Timeframe shows "Daily"

- [ ] Adjust settings: Min=7, Max=11
- [ ] Cycle detection still works
- [ ] Labels positioned appropriately

### Monthly Timeframe
- [ ] Switch to 1M timeframe
- [ ] Adjust settings: Min=34, Max=50
- [ ] Cycle detection works for longer cycles
- [ ] Info box shows monthly data

## Parameter Sensitivity

### Cycle Length Variations
- [ ] Test Min=30, Max=60 → More frequent cycles
- [ ] Test Min=50, Max=80 → Less frequent cycles
- [ ] Verify labels adjust to new parameters
- [ ] Info box reflects parameter changes

### Start Date Testing
- [ ] Change start date to 2020-01-01
